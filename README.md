When using the NDBC data collector, make sure to create a folder to use for your directory. 
1.) Create Folder for all buoy data
2.) Create a folder with the name of the buoy you are interested (using only lowercase letters if they are in the ID)
3.) Copy part of the path from C: to before the buoy ID (ex: C:/Users/Example/Buoy_Data/44007 -> "C:/Users/Example/Buoy_Data")
